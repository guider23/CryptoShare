## Decentralized Image Sharing with IPFS & Blockchain  

This project is a decentralized image-sharing system that leverages IPFS for storage and Ethereum smart contracts for ownership tracking. It allows users to upload image hashes to IPFS, store them on the blockchain, and retrieve ownership details.  

Features:  
Upload images to IPFS and store the hash on the blockchain  
Track image ownership using Ethereum smart contracts  
Retrieve all stored images along with their owners  
Built with Solidity, Hardhat, and Ethers.js  

First of all,run this on cmd on the same folder to install all dependencies.  

```bash
npm install
```

Future improvements: Frontend integration, MetaMask authentication, and deployment on a public testnet!
